# Residential Load Prediction and Tariff Optimization

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for residential energy consumption using machine learning techniques. It also analyzes the impact of various tariff structures on consumer behavior. By accurately predicting energy demand, utilities can optimize their operations, and consumers can manage their energy usage more effectively, leading to cost savings and improved energy efficiency.

## Motivation
With the increasing demand for electricity and the need for sustainable energy practices, understanding residential energy consumption patterns is crucial. This project addresses the challenge of predicting energy load and optimizing tariff structures to encourage energy conservation among consumers.

## Research Focus
1. **Residential Load Prediction**: Developing predictive models for residential energy consumption based on historical data.
2. **Impact of Tariff Structures**: Analyzing how different tariff models influence energy consumption patterns among residential consumers.
3. **Machine Learning Applications**: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy of load forecasts.

## Objectives
- To analyze historical load data and identify consumption patterns.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of various tariff structures on energy usage.
- To implement machine learning models for accurate load prediction.
- To provide actionable insights for utilities and consumers.

## Methodology
